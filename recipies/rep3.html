  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <p>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
    <p />

  <p>salt and pepper to taste
    <p />

  <p>1 tablespoon olive oil
    <p />

    <p />

  <p>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
    <p />

  <p>1 cup white wine
    <p />

  <p>1 tablespoon capers
    <p />



  <h1>Directions</h1>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown chicken in oil
    and butter for 5 to 7 minutes per side; remove from skillet, and set aside.</p>

    to skillet, and pour in reserved artichoke liquid and wine. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 10 to 15
    minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
